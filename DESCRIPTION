Description: Monster Rancher 2 is a video game for the original PlayStation
    where the player obtains monsters from a market, by unlocking them at a
    shrine, or by combining existing monsters in a lab. The success of
    combining two particular monsters depends on those monsters' attributes.
    This package provides data and functions that help players determine the
    quality of combinations and plan out breeding trees to get to a desired
    ending monster.
