# {combiner}: R Tools for Breeding Monsters in MR2

Monster Rancher 2 is a video game for the original PlayStation where the player
obtains monsters from a market, by unlocking them at a shrine, or by combining
existing monsters in a lab. The success of combining two particular monsters
depends on those monsters' attributes. This package provides data and functions
that help players determine the quality of combinations and plan out breeding
trees to get to a desired ending monster.
